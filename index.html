                <span style="color:blue; text-emphasis:initial;">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</span> was born on <span style="color:blue ">15 October 1931</span> to a 
                    Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, 
                    then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.
                     His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.
                      Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
                       His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders, the family had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women. Their business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add to the family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.

             in his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics.
              After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School,
                     Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.
                      He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Institute_of_Technology" target="blank">Madras Institute of Technology.</a>
                       While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline".[23] He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF

                <p>

                     in 1960, Kalam joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau, Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the<a href="/wiki/Defence_Research_and_Development_Organisation" title="Defence Research and Development Organisation" target="blank">Defence Research and Development Organisation</a> He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO.
                      Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist.[13] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965.
                     In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.

        <li>Kalam, a man who spent over five decades in public service, including one as ‘The President,’ owned very little. He didn’t have any real estate, a television, a refrigerator, a vehicle, or air conditioning, but he did have 2,500 books, six shirts, a pair of shoes, a wristwatch, four pants, and three suits.</li>
        <li>He never charged a fee for any of the talks he gave within or outside of the nation.</li>   
        <li>He was a vegetarian who was always satisfied with the food he was given.</li> 
        <li>He was a devout man who made a point of saying his morning prayer every day.</li>
        <li>He never wore his faith on his sleeves, nor did he exaggerate his poor beginnings.</li>
        <li>‘Wings of Fire,’ his autobiography, was first published in English and has since been translated into thirteen languages, including Chinese and French.</li>
        <li>I Am Kalam,’ a film based on Kalam’s life, was directed by Nila Madhab Panda in 2011.</li>
